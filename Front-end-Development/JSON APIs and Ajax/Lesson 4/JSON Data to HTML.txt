Now that we're getting data from a JSON API, let's display it in our 
HTML.

We can use the .forEach() method to loop through our data and modify 
our HTML elements.

First, let's declare an html variable with var html = "";.

Then, let's loop through our JSON, adding more HTML to that variable. 
When the loop is finished, we'll render it.

Here's the code that does this:

json.forEach(function(val) {
  var keys = Object.keys(val);
  html += "<div class = 'cat'>";
  keys.forEach(function(key) {
    html += "<strong>" + key + "</strong>: " + val[key] + "<br>";
  });
  html += "</div><br>";
});
