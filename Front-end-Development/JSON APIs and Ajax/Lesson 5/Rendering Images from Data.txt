We've seen from the last two lessons that each object in our JSON 
array contains an imageLink key with a value that is the URL of a 
cat's image.

When we're looping through these objects, let's use this imageLink
 property to display this image in an img element.

Here's the code that does this:

html += "<img src = '" + val.imageLink + "' " + "alt='" + val.altText 
+ "'>";
