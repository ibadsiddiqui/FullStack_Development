When our click event happens, we can use jQuery to update an HTML 
element.

Let's make it so that when a user clicks the "Get Message" button, 
we change the text of the element with the class message to say "Here is the message".

We can do this by adding the following code within our click event:

$(".message").html("Here is the message");
