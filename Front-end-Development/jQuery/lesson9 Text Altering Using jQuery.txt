Using jQuery, you can change the text between the start and end tags of an element. 
You can even change HTML markup.

jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and 
ext within an element. Any content previously within the element will 
be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.

Here's how you would rewrite and emphasize the text of our heading:

$("h3").html("<em>jQuery Playground</em>");

jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters 
text without adding tags. In other words, this function will not 
evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, but will instead treat it as 
text you want to replace with.
