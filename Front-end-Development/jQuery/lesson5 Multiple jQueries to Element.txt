Now you know three ways of targeting elements: by type: $("button"), 
by class: $(".btn"), and by id $("#target1").

Using .addClass(), add only one class at a time to the same element, three different ways:

Add the animated class to all elements with type button.

Add the shake class to all the buttons with class .btn.

Add the btn-primary class to the button with id #target1.
