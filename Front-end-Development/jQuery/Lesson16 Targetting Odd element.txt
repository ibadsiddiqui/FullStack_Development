You can also target all the even-numbered elements.

Here's how you would target all the odd-numbered elements with 
class target and give them classes:

$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");

Note that jQuery is zero-indexed, meaning that, counter-intuitively, :odd selects the second element, fourth element, and so on.

Try selecting all the even-numbered elements and giving them the 
classes of animated and shake.
$(."target:even").adClass("animated shake");
