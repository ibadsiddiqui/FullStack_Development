You've seen why id attributes are so convenient for targeting with 
jQuery selectors. But you won't always have such neat ids to work 
with.

Fortunately, jQuery has some other tricks for targeting the right 
elements.

jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. target:nth-child(n) 
css selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the 
target class or element type.

Here's how you would give the third element in each well the 
bounce class:

$(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");

Make the second child in each of your well elements bounce. 
You must target the children of element with the target class.
