In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the 
contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right 
of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;

to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are 
operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in 
one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

myVar += 5; will add 5 to myVar.

Instructions
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.
