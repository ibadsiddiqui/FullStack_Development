The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together 
the dot or bracket notation.

Here is a nested object:

var ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
}
ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;  // "secrets"
ourStorage.desk.drawer; // "stapler"

Instructions
Access the myStorage object to retrieve the contents of the glove 
box. Use bracket notation for properties with a space in their name
