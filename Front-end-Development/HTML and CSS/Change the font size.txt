Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:
h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}
Create a second p element with the following kitty ipsum text: 
    Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, 
    shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.

Inside the same <style> tag that contains your red-text class, create an entry for p elements and set the font-size 
to 16 pixels (16px).

Note:
Due to browser implementation differences, you may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the tests on this challenge.

Also, please do not add a class attribute to your new p element.
