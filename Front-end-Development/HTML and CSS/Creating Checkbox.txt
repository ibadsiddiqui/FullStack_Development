Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.
Checkboxes are a type of input
Each of your checkboxes should be nested within its own label element.
All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.
Here's an example of a checkbox:

<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>

Add to your form a set of three checkboxes. Each checkbox should be nested within its own label element.
All three should share the name attribute of personality.
