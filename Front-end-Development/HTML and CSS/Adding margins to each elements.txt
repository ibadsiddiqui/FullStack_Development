Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has a different margin on each of its sides.
CSS allows you to control the margin of an element on all four sides with 
margin-top,
margin-right, 
margin-bottom, 
and margin-left properties.

Give the green box a margin of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.
