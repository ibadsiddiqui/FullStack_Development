        <p class="red"> Remember that you can attach classes to HTML elements by using class="your-class-here" within the relevant 
            element's opening tag. Remember that CSS class selectors require a period at the beginning like this:
                .blue-text 
                {
                color: blue;
                }
            But also remember that class declarations don't use a period, like this:
            Apply the red-text class to your h2 and p elements.
        </p>
